# YOLOv4_and_CNN_Hand_Gestures_Recognition
In this git hub repository you will find a code that train the CNN model step by step and then test this model through live video by using YOLOv4 and OpenCV libraries to detect and crop hands 
In this code it will detect hands using YOLOv4 and then crops the hand and resize it then send it to the CNN Model to classify it
The code has headings and comments explaining it all
This model has made the detection up to 6 meters
